# smartcarparkingsystem
This project is a prototype of a smart car parking system designed to demonstrate how real-time parking slot availability can be monitored and managed using an Arduino UNO. This project is ideal for students, hobbyists, or anyone looking to build a fundamental IoT-based system to solve a common real-world problem.

This project is a prototype of a smart parking system that uses an **Arduino UNO** to manage and monitor parking slot availability in real time.

The system is designed to provide a clear demonstration of how sensors and simple logic can be used to solve a real-world problem. It's an excellent project for students and hobbyists interested in physical computing and basic IoT principles.

### Key Features

* **Ultrasonic Sensors:** Detects vehicles in each parking slot.

* **LED Status Indicators:** Uses red and green LEDs to show whether a slot is occupied or available.

* **LCD Display:** Provides a real-time count of available parking slots.

* **Automated Gate:** A servo motor acts as an entry gate that opens only when slots are free.

### Components

* Arduino UNO

* IR Sensors (HC-SR04)

* 16x2 LCD Display

* Servo Motor (SG90)

* LEDs, resistors, breadboard, and jumper wires

### How to Use

1.  Assemble the hardware as shown in the circuit diagram (not included in this file).

2.  Upload the project code to your Arduino UNO.

3.  The system will automatically begin monitoring the parking slots.
